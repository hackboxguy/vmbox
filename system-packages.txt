# VirtualBox Alpine Demo - System Packages List
#
# This file defines system-level packages (libraries, tools) that are built
# and installed into the rootfs BEFORE application packages are built.
# These packages install to /usr and are available system-wide.
#
# Format (6 fields, pipe-separated):
#   NAME|SOURCE|VERSION|BUILD_SYSTEM|BUILD_OPTIONS|DEPS
#
# Fields:
#   NAME          - Package name (for logging/identification)
#   SOURCE        - Source URL: tarball (.tar.gz/.tar.bz2/.tar.xz), git (.git), or file://
#   VERSION       - Version string (for logging, also used as git tag if applicable)
#   BUILD_SYSTEM  - Build system: "autoconf" | "cmake" | "hook"
#   BUILD_OPTIONS - Configure/cmake options (comma-separated, e.g., --with-openssl,--disable-static)
#   DEPS          - Alpine package dependencies (comma-separated)
#
# Notes:
#   - All packages install to /usr (system-wide prefix)
#   - Packages are processed in order - put dependencies first
#   - BUILD_SYSTEM "hook" requires packages/<name>-hook.sh script
#   - Empty fields can be left blank (e.g., ||)
#   - Lines starting with # are comments
#
# Examples:
#
#   # Autoconf package from tarball:
#   gloox|https://camaya.net/download/gloox-1.0.28.tar.bz2|1.0.28|autoconf|--with-openssl,--without-gnutls|openssl-dev,libidn-dev,zlib-dev
#
#   # CMake package from git:
#   mylib|https://github.com/user/mylib.git|v2.0.0|cmake|-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON|
#
#   # Custom hook script:
#   special-lib|https://example.com/special.tar.gz|1.0|hook||build-base
#
# =============================================================================

# Gloox XMPP library with OpenSSL support (required by jsonrpc-tcp-srv/xmproxysrv)
# The Alpine gloox-dev package uses GnuTLS, but we need OpenSSL for compatibility
